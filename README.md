## **Project Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive, data-driven evaluation of Diego Pablo Simeone’s influence on Atlético Madrid since his appointment as head coach in the 2011–2012 season through to 2023–2024. The analysis spans multiple dimensions of the club’s performance across domestic and international competitions, highlighting how Simeone has shaped the identity and competitive stature of the team.

The report begins by comparing Atlético Madrid’s achievements across all major titles before and after Simeone’s tenure, providing context to his impact on the club's overall success. A deep dive into La Liga performance illustrates changes in metrics such as goals scored, goals conceded, and final league standings during his era.

To better understand Atlético's evolution under Simeone, the study includes a comparative analysis with league rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona. This comparison features average points per season, total points accumulated, and the point gap between Atlético and La Liga champions from the 2011–2012 to 2023–2024 seasons.

The analysis further explores the outcomes of Madrid Derbies during Simeone’s reign, offering insights into performance against cross-town rivals. On the European front, the project examines Atlético Madrid’s performance in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League—covering attacking and defensive statistics at each stage, contrasting home and away results, and listing teams the club has progressed against or been eliminated by.

In addition, the project assesses Atlético Madrid’s track record against top-tier clubs from Spain, England, Germany, and Italy in UEFA knockout stages and finals. Finally, Simeone’s overall contribution to the club’s European history is quantified, emphasizing his long-term impact on Atlético Madrid’s presence in international competitions.
